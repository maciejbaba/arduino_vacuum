project of vacuum, self driving, arduino



jxd rk-370 wheel motor
dc motor works without problem on 3.3v and 5v
datasheet probably -> https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf/1017724/SHINEMINGTECH/RK-370CA-081050/1
its either dc 12-30v or dc 6-18v as in the datasheet
but it works on 3.3v and 5v


dc motor for vacuum cleaner is 12v but works on 5v (doesnt have enough power to suck anything), on 3.3v it doesnt work at all


the same for the dc motors for brushes, they work on 5v and spin normally a little bit slow will check on 12v later but they works, didnt check on 3.3v
